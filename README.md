## ‚öôÔ∏è‚Äã Setup - Minilibx
For reference, here's [hsmit's guide](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx) and [gontjarow's guide](https://gontjarow.github.io/MiniLibX/) to minilibx.

On your Makefile, check in which OS your programme is being compiled by doing
```
UNAME = $(shell uname)
ifeq ($(UNAME), Darwin)
	# we're in a Mac
ifeq ($(UNAME), Linux)
	# we're using Linux
endif
```

### üêß‚Äã Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
```
On your Makefile, after compiling minilibx, compile your project with the static library ```libmlx.a``` and the additional grapfical libraries ```-lXext -lX11 -lm -lz```.

### üçè‚Äã Apple
Download the minilibx_mms provided on intra.
On your Makefile, after compiling minilibx, copy the dynamic library ```libmlx.dylib``` to your root repository, to facilitate its usage.

## Raycasting
[Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

### Intro
Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen.

### Raycasting Basics
The basic idea is that the map is a 2d grid, with each square being either 0 or 1 (wall or no wall).

### Vectors Recap
Vectors are abstract notions but always have 2 essential components:
1. A direction in space
2. A magnitude or length

Vector in 2D euclidian space:

`v = 
[ vx
  vy ]`

In computer graphics we can easily represent the above as a 2-element array of floating point numbers or a struct containing 2 floats. In 2D, we can say the direction of the vector is equal to `m = vy / vx`. This expresses the change in vertical position per unit of horizontal position x.

Vector magnitude (also called the norm) is represented by the formula `sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2)`

## Resources Dump - to be organised
* If you are doing your project on Linux and you want to hook an event to close the window on the ‚ùå you have to do it as: ```mlx_hook(mlx->win, 33, 0, destroy_window, mlx);```
